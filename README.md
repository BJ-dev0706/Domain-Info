Today, Iâ€™m excited to introduce a Google Chrome Extension that I believe will benefit your business. 
While it might be too simple to call it a "project," I still feel itâ€™s important to share.

This Google Chrome Extension retrieves and displays information about a domain. 
I emphasize its importance because of the increasing number of malicious websites on the internet. 
Hackers often send fake links, asking you to visit them. Once you click on the link, a notification might pop up, prompting you to install an app. 
If you install the app without thinking... ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜–

This is why itâ€™s crucial to know the information about a domain before interacting with it. 
Iâ€™ve only been working on this for a short time, but Iâ€™ve already encountered this issue twice. 
Below is an example of a fake site.

(This call was on August 11th and this site was created on August 8th. This was strange and I declined the request.)

Reflecting on these experiences, I realized the need for this project, which led me to create it.

You can access this project here.

You might chuckle when you see the simplicity of the code, but I believe it will be helpful for your business.
